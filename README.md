# Build a Food Review website ðŸŒ®ðŸ¥‘

This week's project at the Technigo boot camp was a team project to practice our JavaScript and API skills and to practice working as a real team using GitHub. The project was to build a website that lists restaurants, reviews and information based on location. 
My team was tasked with using the Zomato API (https://developers.zomato.com/) to list Seafood restaurants in Lisbon, Portugal in the style of the Online Pizza site.

Tech:
<br>JavaScript(ES6), HTML, CSS</br>

Togeteher as a mob, my team did the foundations of the project together. We fetched data from the Zomato API and presented all data on the page in a HTML structure. We included data on the restaurant name, the average cost for a dinner there, the address of the restaurant, an image for each restaurant and the average rating of each restaurant. We used filter functions so that the users can sort the restaurants on price and rating.
